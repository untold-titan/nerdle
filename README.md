Built with React Native by Mitchell Miller (untold-titan) and Jaryd Hibbert(Hibbs18) for CPRG 303-H: Mobile Application Development

PACKAGES USED:
We used only one package in our application:
    - React Elements Library 
    
    This package is a component library which contains UI elements and helpers used in React Navigation. 

Package Install Commands:

To install the package you must first ensure that you have @react-navigation/native and all of the installed dependancies. The command for this is as follows:

    -- npm install @react-navigation/native

After @react-navigation/native is installed myou can then install the React Elements Library through the following command: 

    -- npm i @react-navigation/elements

ADDITIONAL STEPS TO RUN THE APPLICATION:

Below you will find the steps required to run our application "Nerdle" on any computer through an android emulator:

These instructions are done assuming you currently have android studio and the android SDK up and running. If you DO NOT have the android SDK, follow one of the three links below for your respective device to create the environment. This will then allow you to run the application we have created. 

    Windows: https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment?os=windows

    macOS: https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment 

    Linux: https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment?os=linux

Once the above requirements have been met you are ready to run "Nerdle". To begin, open up your terminal and change your directory to the folder location which contains our application folder. This folder should be named "Nerdle". The comand is as follows and will change per device:

    the icon "~" represents HOME or C: on macOS. 

    -- cd ~/Downloads/Nerdle

                OR

    -- cd C:/Downloads/Nerdle

Once you have entered the correct directory which contains the nerdle application & you have your android SDK + emulator, you can run the following command:

    -- npm run android

Congratulations!

You have now installed the android SDK & ran our application: "Nerdle"
